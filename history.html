<h2 style="text-align:center">History</h2>

<center><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The mustering of Telecommunictions Technician (TELSTECH) was formed to 
manage the new mechanised telecommunications equipment (Teletype) and up to date mechanical cryptographic equipment which 
was being introduced to the RAAF in the early 1950s.   Previous to this, the new equipment was looked after by Radio Servicemen, 
but the RAAF saw the need for a specialist mustering, which  was in the first instance, called Telegraphist Technician.   
The TELSTECH mustering dragged behind the Radio Serviceman (soon to be called Technician) mustering in many ways, the 
greatest of which was the disparity in pay levels.   It took quite some years for the TELSTECHs to be given equal pay 
(1965) with the Radio Technicians (Radtechs), and a few more years to become completely autonomous (read get rid of the 
RADTECHs who had been trained on new crypto equipment installed in the 60s, instead of TELSTECHs).<P>

The TELSTECH mustering came into being in 1953, and during that year several courses were completed, one at Ballarat, and 
the others at the PMG School at Annandale in Sydney.   Members of  these courses were not the first TELSTECHs, the honour 
going to remusters from other musterings (Wireless Operator Mechanic, Telegraphist Supervisor, Radio Serviceman) - who were 
the first TELSTECHs is unknown at this time.<P>

The TELSTECH mustering grew as newer and more complex equipment was installed.   Personnel numbered up to 250 in the 
mustering's heyday in the 70s and early 80s, with new TELSTECH courses commencing regularly.   By the mid 80s, new 
telecommunications technology was being considered, which would sound the death knell for the mustering, and on 30 November
 1989, all serving TELSTECHs were remustered to RADTECH (Ground) (RADTECHG), much to their disgust. <p>

 The stigma of being called a RADTECH (G) was not to last long, when a new mustering was formed to manage all ground 
 telecommunications equipment. This mustering was called Communications Electronics Technician (CETECH), and was the 
 amalgamation of the TELSTECH, RADTECH(G) and Telsrig (Linesmen) musterings. The CETECH mustering has 23 Warrant Officers, 
 50 Flight Sergeants, 112 Sergeants, 159 Corporals, and 205 AC/LAC/ACW/LACWs at last count. CETECHs are posted to all 
 RAAF bases in Australia, and selected overseas posts.<P>

A <A HREF="reunions/1999_november.html">reunion</A> was held at Glenbrook over the weekend 29/30 November 1999, to 
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the closure of the TELSTECH mustering.   The various activities over the weekend were 
attended by about 100 people - read the report below.<P><center/></FONT>
