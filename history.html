											<h2>History</h2>
										</header>

										<div>
											The mustering of Telecommunictions Technician (TELSTECH) was formed to
											manage the new mechanised telecommunications equipment (Teletype) and up to date mechanical cryptographic
											equipment which
											was being introduced to the RAAF in the early 1950s. Previous to this, the new equipment was looked after by
											Radio Servicemen,
											but the RAAF saw the need for a specialist mustering, which was in the first instance, called Telegraphist
											Technician.
											The TELSTECH mustering dragged behind the Radio Serviceman (soon to be called Technician) mustering in many
											ways, the
											greatest of which was the disparity in pay levels. It took quite some years for the TELSTECHs to be given equal pay
											(1965) with the Radio Technicians (Radtechs), and a few more years to become completely autonomous (read get rid
											of the
											RADTECHs who had been trained on new crypto equipment installed in the 60s, instead of TELSTECHs).<P>
										
										</div>
										<div>
											The TELSTECH mustering came into being in 1953, and during that year several courses were completed, one at
											Ballarat, and
											the others at the PMG School at Annandale in Sydney. Members of these courses were not the first TELSTECHs, the
											honour
											going to remusters from other musterings (Wireless Operator Mechanic, Telegraphist Supervisor, Radio Serviceman) -
											who were
											the first TELSTECHs is unknown at this time.<P>
										
												The TELSTECH mustering grew as newer and more complex equipment was installed. Personnel numbered up to 250 in
												the
												mustering's heyday in the 70s and early 80s, with new TELSTECH courses commencing regularly. By the mid 80s, new
												telecommunications technology was being considered, which would sound the death knell for the mustering, and on
												30 November
												1989, all serving TELSTECHs were remustered to RADTECH (Ground) (RADTECHG), much to their disgust.

											The stigma of being called a RADTECH (G) was not to last long, when a new mustering was formed to manage all ground
											telecommunications equipment. This mustering was called Communications Electronics Technician (CETECH), and was the
											amalgamation of the TELSTECH, RADTECH(G) and Telsrig (Linesmen) musterings. The CETECH mustering has 23 Warrant
											Officers,
											50 Flight Sergeants, 112 Sergeants, 159 Corporals, and 205 AC/LAC/ACW/LACWs at last count. CETECHs are posted to all
											RAAF bases in Australia, and selected overseas posts.<P>

											<p>Many <A HREF="/reunions/2025_Brisbane.html">reunions and get togethers</A> have been organised over the years to
												commemorate the TELSTECH mustering. If you are planning a reunion or get together, contact the TELSTECH
												Association as we can do mailouts and have contact details of TELSTECHS in your area. Doesn't have to be
												official, and you will be surprised who comes out of the woodwork.</p>
