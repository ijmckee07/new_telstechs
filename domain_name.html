    WE ARE NOW AN INCORPORATED ASSOCIATION
    
    Our Domain name and hosting company will soon change to telstechs.org.au</b><br>
    Back in the bad old days when the internet started, it was possible to name a domain anything you wanted. Since then
    the standards people have stepped in and changed what you can apply for. Using the word 'RAAF' in your domain is 
    not allowed, so <u>raaftelstechs.org.au</u> has been put on a list of domain names that cannot be renewed. 
    It expires in Jan 2024.
    <p>However, to get a domain name ending in <u>.org.au</u> we need to have an incorporated association to apply.
    Therefore, the committee has embarked on applying for an incorporated entity called <b>Telstechs Association Inc.</b></p>
    When the Association documentation comes through, the application for the new domain name will commence.<p>

    <p>We are also required to register with the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profit Commission (ACNC) which will give validity
    in the pursuit of grants for the Association.</p>
    <p>Being a registered organisation we will be eligible to apply for grants from Commonwealth/State Governments and 
    Corporations that support non-profit associations.</p>
    <p>The current members and life members will be able to benefit from the proceeds of the grants as they engage with the 
    association.</p>
    <p>All this work is being accomplished in the background by the very small committee in an effort to benefit the 
        members and keep the Association strong and healthy.</p>
