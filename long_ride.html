    <p>Hi,
    I’m Chris, and I’m retired. I’m a passionate motorbike rider (although not so much these days after hip and shoulder
    injuries). My preferred type of ride is ‘ride for a cause’, and I do 2 (sometimes 3) of these rides every year when they
    come up: TheLongRide, “Scootaville” (Defence veterans fellowship ride, and fundraiser for Legacy), and the “Black Dog
    Ride” (a ride that promotes awareness of the impacts of depression/mental health). These are all typically long,
    multi-day rides.<p>
    The ride I’m fund raising for at the moment is “The Long Ride”, flyer above. These run every 18 months or so, and this
    year in late May/early June – assuming post-cyclone Jasper infrastructure repairs allow it, will see “us” ride from
    every capital city, meeting at junctions along the major highways – to eventually arrive at Port Douglas in north
    Queensland (around 3700km one-way for us in the ACT). This ride allows us to both fundraise and, at overnight stops and
    wherever we need to refuel, provide interested parties awareness of men’s health and in particular (very important in
    regional Australia) a message of understanding of Prostate Cancer and the newer ways of getting checked EARLY for this
    insidious and most common form of cancer. It’s called a PSA test and is a simple test done with the rest of your routine
    blood tests.<p>
    How you can help: If you’d like to donate to this very worthwhile cause, refer to the attached QR code and web address
    (longrideaustralia.au). The web site provides details on how you can contribute. While you can contribute directly (note
    that donations of $2 or more are tax deductible across Australia), if you click on the icon “ACT Long Riders” under
    https://fundraise.pcfa.org.au/fundraisers/thelongride2024, these contributions go through the ride group I am a member
    of.<p>
    Thanks in advance for your support.<p>
    Regards, <p>Chris
