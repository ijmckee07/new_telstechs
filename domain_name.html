    Our Domain name and hosting company have to change!</b><br>
    Back in the bad old days when the internet started, it was possible to name a domain anything you wanted. Since then
    the standards people have stepped in and changed what you can apply for. Using the work RAAF in your domain is apparently
    not allowed, so <u>raaftelstechs.org.au</u> has been put on a list of domain names that cannot be renewed. 
    It expires in Jan 2024.<p>
    However, to get a domain name with the <u>.org.au</u> we need to have an incorporated association to apply.
    Therefore, the committee has embarked on applying for an incorporated entity called <b>Telstechs Association Inc.</b><p>
    When the Association documentation comes through, the application for the new domain name will commence.<p>
    Being a registered organisation we will be eligible to apply for grants from Commonwealth/State Governments and 
    Corporations that support non-profit associations.<p>
    The current members and life members will be able to benefit from the proceeds of the grants as they engage with the 
    association.<p>
        All this work is being accomplished in the background by the very small committee in an effort to benefit the 
        members and keep the Association strong and healthy. 
        
<p>
